Amidst the exponential growth in world population, the living standard has been
raised profoundly owing to the unprecedented developments in Science and
Technology. However, the humankind yet has to face great many challenges in
furthering the growth and to sustain it by employing Science and Technology to
search for cost effective, environment friendly and recyclable sources of supplies like
materials, energy, food and water for the ever-growing population. As the global
population is anticipated to exceed ten billion in the forthcoming couple of decades,
the rule of Science, particularly the rule of Chemical Sciences is critical to ensure
value added products for sustainable development of the society in harmony with
the environment. In this context, the Department of Chemistry (Islamia College 
Peshawar, Pakistan) is organizing an national conference on the theme <i>
“Chemistry for growth and sustainability”</i> to discuss the challenges that Chemical
Scientists will face in averting the multiple crises in materials, climate, energy, food
and water sectors while ensuring sustainable growth for high living standards of the
humankind.
The basic aim of the conference is to create an opportunity for the global researchers
in academia and industry to interact and discuss the challenges and opportunities in
Chemical Sciences on one hand, and on the other hand, to upgrade their knowledge
and establish long term collaborations for technology transfer which is particularly
important for the Pakistani researchers. The conference include plenary lectures by
the leading experts in the field, invited talks of internationally acclaimed Chemical
Scientists and contributed paper-presentations by the researchers from different
fields of Chemical Sciences.

The Department of Chemistry of Islamia College Peshawar is one of the leading
departments of Chemical Sciences in Pakistan. Presently, a significant number of
students are enrolled in different programs of the Department including BS, M. Phil
and PhD. A highly qualified faculty of 24 members of which 18 are PhD degree
holder is engaged for teaching activities of the Department under a dynamic
leadership, and a very favorable student-faculty ratio is maintained so that to
encourage a close contact between the students and their mentors. Besides teaching,
the faculty is actively involved in research activities in different areas of Chemical
Sciences, for example, organometallic, environmental, synthetic, natural product, bio
and computational chemistry, nanomaterials, polymer etc. to address the challenges
in sustainable growth of the society. For their outstanding work, many of the faculty
members have won prestigious national and international awards.

Islamia College Peshawar is one of the greatest historical institutions of Pakistan and
a great seat of learning since its foundation in 1913 by Sir Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum 
Khan also called the Sir Sayyed of the Frontier. The historically rich and
academically excellent Islamia College Peshawar architectures are the best
embodiment of great Muslim civilization in south Asia. The importance of this
college as a great hub of knowledge, wisdom and enlightenment for the people of
north west frontier province (NWFP) now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is evident from the
fact that the founder of Pakistan, Mr. Muhammad Ali Jinnah aka Quaid-e-Azam, has
visited this College three times (in 1936, 1945 and 1948) and made the College one of
the heirs of his property in 1939. Spread over more than 300 acres of land, the college
was elevated to a status of a full fledge University in 2008 through an act of the
provincial assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The Islamia College Peshawar is
providing education to the students across the length and breadth of Pakistan in its
more than 22 departments of five faculties.
